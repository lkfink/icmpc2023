## Eye movement patterns when playing from memory  
Examining consistency across repeated performances and the relationship between eyes and audio

This repository accompanies the conference paper "Eye movement patterns when playing from memory: Examining consistency across repeated performances and the relationship between eyes and audio," presented in Aug. 2023 in Tokyo, Japan, at the International Conference on Music Perception &amp; Cognition. The paper is available in this repository: `Fink_ICMPC_2023_eyeMovements_Memory_20230616.pdf`.

The core questions in this paper were to see 1) whether eye movement patterns exhibit consistency across multiple performances of the same memorized music, and 2) whether the structure of the performed music is reflected in eye movement patterns.

## Usage
The script `Fink_ICMPC2023_analyses.m` is provided for example purposes only. Data files are not included in the repository, meaning the code will not run as is. 

Additionally, the code relies on third-party toolboxes to calculate the Matrix Profile. Please check this page for the latest information on the matrix profile: [https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html)

#### Schematic example of Matrix Profile Usage
The figure below details the process steps one could use to index audio from eye movement motifs. 
Example audio files are provided for the differently colored examples. You should be able to hear that the audio passages identified by similarity in eye movement patterns are remarkably similar to each other (though not exactly the same). Audio files, named by color-coding in the figure below are included in the `media` folder.
